    "The above flow diagram outlines how circuit design is typically done with BAG.  You will notice that it is largely similar to traditional manual design flow, with two major differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designer focus on designing schematic/layout/testbench generators, instead of specific circuit instances.\n",
    "* Layout is usually done before schematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussions about the benefits of designing circuit generators instead of instances are outside of the scope of this tutorial, so I will assume you are already convinced.  So, why do we design layout generators before schematic generators?  There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since BAG can easily automates layout and post-extraction simulations, there is almost no need for schematic only simulations.\n",
    "* One schematic could correspond to many different layouts (each with a different floorplan strategy), whereas one layout corresponds to exactly one schematic.\n",
    "* It is impossible to determine schematic details such as dummy transistors before layout is done.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Transistors are from the `BAG_prim` library.  In this way this schematic can be ported across process by simply changing the `BAG_prim` library.\n",
    "* Dummy transistors' ports are connected using wire stubs and net labels.  This allows BAG to easy reconnect those ports if necessary.\n",

It is just like the schematic template we seen before, but instead of a symbol view it has an ADEXL view.  To generate a new testbench, BAG will copy and modify both the schematic and the ADEXL view and returns a `Testbench` object that can be used to control simulations from Python."

    "Now that you have an rough idea of how BAG generates new schematics and testbenches, let's try to run the common-source amplifier design flow.  To do so, simple select the code box below and press Ctrl+Enter to evaluate the Python code.  If everything works fine, you should see output messages in the dialog box below the code box, and it should end with DC/AC/Transient simulation plots.  Schematics, layouts, and testbenches should also be generated in the `DEMO_AMP_CS` library in Virtuoso, so you can take a look over there.\n",

    "* Read a specification file to get schematic/layout/testbench/simulation parameters.\n",

You can take a look if you're interested, but the `run_flow()` method definition is reproduced above for your convenience.  You can see it simply calls other methods to generate layout/schematics, run simulations, and post-process simulation results."
